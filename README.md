# pwa-news-app
A Simple Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation. It shows top news headlines from different sources. At first, a particular source is selected. We can change the source inside the app. Moreover, we'll get data from previously visited sources even if we're in offline mode.

#### Two different implementations (Register a particular service worker in _app.js_):
- _sw.js_ - Custom Implementation
- _sw-new.js_ - Using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)

> API: [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
